I have uploaded all the .csv files as a zip file in my Google Drive. I have attached the link here, you could email me in case you are not able to access it.

UPDATE: I have inserated a few additonal Benign and Malware files in the Zip file extracted after the completion of this project.
        I believe it would be helpful to someone who is working in any related project as this.
